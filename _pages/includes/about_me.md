## About Me

Greetings! ðŸ‘‹

I'm **Ziyi Zhao**, currently a Ph.D. student at the **University of Technology Sydney (UTS)**. I'm fortunate to be a member of the [HAI Center (Human-Centric Artificial Intelligence)](https://www.uts.edu.au/research/human-centric-artificial-intelligence-centre), where I work at the intersection of **EEG decoding** and **deep learning**, under the guidance of [Prof. Chin-Teng Lin](https://profiles.uts.edu.au/Chin-Teng.Lin) and [Dr. YK Wang](https://profiles.uts.edu.au/YuKai.Wang).

In June 2023, I completed my Master's degree at the School of Electronic and Information Engineering, **Tongji University**, under the supervision of [Prof. Lei Wang](https://see.tongji.edu.cn/info/1379/10451.htm). Before that, I spent a semester as an exchange student at **EPFL**, Switzerland, working with [Prof. Pascal Fua](https://people.epfl.ch/pascal.fua) and [Dr. Sena Kiciroglu](https://senakicir.github.io/) at the [Computer Vision Laboratory (CVLab)](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/cvlab/) <img src='./images/logo-epfl.png' style='width: 3em;'>. My academic journey began at **Jilin University**, where I received my Bachelor's degree in 2020.

---

My research interests span **brain wave decoding**, **deep learning algorithms**, and **generative AI**. I am particularly passionate about exploring the challenges of **EEG transcription**, **neural representation learning**, and **large-scale generative models**.

To date, I have published **4 peer-reviewed papers** across the domains of **brain-computer interfaces (BCI)**, **human motion modeling**, and **intelligent music generation**. Additionally, I hold **two patents** in the field of intelligent systems and signal processing.
